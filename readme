// An Expense Tracker is a JavaScript project that helps users manage their expenses by adding, categorizing, and tracking spending. It typically includes features like adding transactions, displaying total expenses, filtering by category or date, and visualizing spending trends with charts. The project can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple version or React.js with local storage or Firebase for a more advanced version. Additional features like budget setting, monthly summaries, and CSV export can enhance functionality. Integrating libraries like Chart.js for graphical insights and Redux for state management (in React) can improve the user experience. ðŸš€
